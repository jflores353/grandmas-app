						<h3>Eulogy</h3>
						<p>
							Merejilda was a compassionate and trustworthy lady, with glamour’s
							smiles and sparkling brown eyes. Her affectionate and charismatic
							personality revealed a person of peace and love, who desired
							harmony as a way of life. She was inspirational and nurturing and
							taught her loved ones how to handle a blessing or adversity while
							bringing out the best in them. She enjoyed a close relationship
							with those she loved and was significantly parental in nature. She
							was always one to show affection be it with a simple handshake, a
							hug, proper greeting, or a contagious smile. For when you do one
							of the aforementioned jesters you get one in return. She taught
							her children to respect, manners, integrity and showed them to
							mature being independent. Merejilda was an active and enthusiastic
							woman who pursued life with gusto and lived life to the fullest.
							She made a sufficient impact on family, friends, and people she
							met, and never said no to offer a helping hand. She leaves her
							family and friends with a treasury of memories and life lessons.
							Merejilda had a strong faith and demonstrated that GOD was
							important in her daily life. She was a member of the St Joseph
							Catholic Church. Merejilda and Roman served the Lord together in
							the joys and sorrows of life. She was a devoted spouse, mother,
							grandmother, sister, and friend.
						</p>

						<p>
							Merejilda’s story began in 1924. She was born in Lockhart, Texas
							to Juanita and Mercedes Rosales on April 2nd. She was their last
							born. She was joined by her brothers Martin, Fidel, Mauricio,
							Rene, and her sister Dominga. At the age of 1 ½, Merejilda and her
							siblings were adopted by Josefa Ramos and Juan Gonzales, due to a
							family tragedy. Therefore, the six siblings were all raised in the
							San Marcos, Texas area. As adults, her siblings reunited to the
							Lubbock, Texas area and were buried in the vicinity upon their
							death. While living with her new mom she would often provide
							assistance with her mom’s profession. Josefa was a seamstress,
							midwife, and herbalist who practiced unlicensed health and medical
							care to the Hispanic community as early as the 1900s. Josefa did
							this work due to the Jim Crow Laws of racism which started in 1890
							and continued until 1965. Merejilda provided minor medical care or
							advice to many Hispanics and family members who sought her
							services due to medical costs. She married Roman Garcia Flores on
							August 17, 1942, in Kingsville, Texas. Merejilda was 18 and Roman
							was 25. Merejilda and Roman were married for seventy-five years.
							This is the most joyful gift that few will encounter in their
							lifetime.

						<p>
							Merejilda did various tasks during her work career. Her main job
							was taking care of the household, as she took responsibility for
							care of her family. She also raised and cared for many of her
							grandchildren and children of her friends. She loved the outdoors
							and worked in her garden and yard. She was well known for her
							cooking skills, appetizing and delicious dishes. Family members,
							relatives, friends, and sometimes strangers left her house with
							satisfying and content smiles due to a full stomach and enjoyable
							conversations. She loved family gathering and seeing her family
							talking, playing and enjoying each other in peace. She was known
							for her hospitable nature, caring demeanor, and her home was
							always filled with people and activity. But now she is free, there
							will be no more struggles, all is left behind. She has found peace
							with the Lord.
						</p>

						<p>
							Merejilda was preceded in death by both her biological and adopted
							parents. She again grieved with the passing of all her siblings,
							numerous relatives and friends throughout her life. Her new family
							mourned with the loss of her first child Anna on January 4, 2008,
							and her second child Carmelite on December 21, 2012, her third
							child Paula on June 23, 2016, and the man of her life Roman Flores
							who passed on September 30, 2017, as a Centurion.
						</p>

						<p>
							Merejilda and Roman raised two nephews Edward and Philip due to
							the loss of their parents and that started a family of great joy
							and happiness. Then the Lord blessed Merejilda and Roman with 4
							girls and 7 boys during their marriage, in the following order,
							Anna, Carmelita, Benny, Paula, Francis, Joe, Roman (Jr.), Ricky,
							Johnny, Marty, and Steven.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<p>
							Merejilda is symbolized by the dove of peace. She was an
							inspirational role model. She valued order and cherished
							tradition, and the purity of home, and family. She established
							important steps about growing up to become good citizens. She was
							a shining example for showing love, faith, integrity, manners,
							respect, responsibility, happiness and right from wrong. She
							taught her family not to be prejudiced or judgmental. Her family
							is a better group of adults because of her life experiences, words
							of wisdom, and great influence in their lives. Her kindness, love,
							laughter, “and most of all Roman “will never be forgotten, but he
							will be missed. She grieved at the loss of so many lives during
							her numerous years of life. Those who knew Merejilda Flores know
							how she spent her days on earth. Those who have left before her
							will welcome her with smiles and open arms.
